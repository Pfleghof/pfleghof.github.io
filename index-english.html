<p>
Pfleghof is a largely self-administered student dormitory under StuWe, located right in the historic
city centre of Tübingen. We perceive ourselves as a community where we value and respect each
other. We see ourselves as a part of the many other housing projects in Tübingen. As a
community, we strive to nurture the togetherness at Pfleghof in a supportive and creative way.
Pfleghof is a place of exchange for plurality, creativity, and openness. We put our ideals into
practice by organising different types of social events and by sharing our common resources. Here
exists an open space where individual interests, hobbies and ideas can be realised and shared
with others. People with different and varied perceptions on the universe live in Pfleghof, which
creates a rich and cultured living environment. Fundamental to our community beliefs, we do not
tolerate racism, sexism, discrimination against LGBTQIA+, or any other type of discrimination
against oppressed and marginalised groups. When we ourselves, or others, behave contrary to
our beliefs, we want to actively point out such misconduct and respond appropriately. We are
constantly working to get closer to our ideals. We strive to be a safe place.
</p>
<p>
As part of our self-administered living arrangement, we select new flatmates through
interview-style meetings. In addition, we hold a mandatory plenary meeting with all 36 flatmates
that takes place at least once a semester. At this meeting we arrange community duties and elect
flatmates to be responsible for various administrative roles, make plans for parties, plan our
famous winterfeast, and other joint activities, as well as discuss important topics regarding our
community life. We are a large, colourful, loud, and sometimes quiet household and we are
looking for roommates who are excited to actively participate in our unique community!
