											<h3>What does that mean, being self-organised</h3>
											<p>Self-organised means that we are officially part of the Studierendenwerk, but can basically
											sort out everything on our own. On the one hand that includes some duties like organising,
											cleaning, repairs, finding roommates and more. On the other hand, it gives us the chance to
											shape our community and be creative. Parties, exhibitions, vacations, cooking, arranging our
											living space exactly the way we want.</p>
											
											<p>Apart from Pfleghof, there are other self-organised dorms and housing projects in Tübingen
											that officially belong to the Studierendenwerk (Münze 7, Schimpf, Geissweg or
											Leibnizhäuser). We usually stay in touch and organise events together quite regularly. We are
											not anonymous dorms, but like to consider ourselves as a housing project where you live
											together as a community.</p>
											
											<p>Since the rooms are rented to us by the Studierendenwerk, unfortunately only students
											enrolled at Tübingen University can live with us. The period of residence is currently limited
											to 6 semesters, but it is possible to apply for an extension by doing jobs for the community.</p>
											
											<p>What does that mean for us?<br>
											We are looking for people who are interested in living together with others in a friendly
											relationship and who are willing to actively engage in self-administration. Everyone has a
											small job which contributes to the functioning of our community such as organising cleaning
											plans or managing the allocation of rooms. The general assembly, which takes place at least
											once every semester, is an obligatory event for everyone. We also need everyone’s help at the
											Pfleghof party, which takes place once every semester. Apart from that, we wish for our
											housemates to readily spend time with others, introduce their ideas and their personalities into
											the community and be open for a varied and slightly chaotic life together.</p>
